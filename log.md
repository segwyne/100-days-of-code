# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Went through multiple tutorials on how to use GitHub so I can get started with this.  Created repo for our tech website and began building that.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I have done so much just to get started, without actually creating anything (aside from useless example repos).  It felt silly to have a nice public webpage in which I built link to a lameass site for ourselves, so I started on our own site now. I created the header and navigation bar and also created a template css sheet for myself to stay organized.

**Link to work:** [Saunders Tech Site](https://github.com/segwyne/Saunders-tech-site)  I'm not sure how to link to a specific commit yet, or even if that is possible.

### Day 2: August 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started working on my sewing website so I can save working on the tech site to do with Btechie. I created the repo, uploaded the very base files I had already.  I worked on making the flexbox navigation work, and worked on the background for the header using GIMP.  

**Thoughts**: I get frustrated with the git commands, particularly when I hve existing files and can't reconcile them with the repo.  I resorted to moving the files I had just worked on to a holding space, then deleting and remaking the folder for them, pulling the git from Github, and then adding the updated folders back into the new folder and then I was able to push them.  Very frustrating.  But I finally got it accomplished and I can focus on just the actual coding part in the future.

**Link(s) to work**: [Commit for Segwyne's Needle](https://github.com/segwyne/segwynes-needle/commit/3bcf4768a2ecb2c9cbdd2b5e5b0806b33f10cc3f)

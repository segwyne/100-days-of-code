# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Went through multiple tutorials on how to use GitHub so I can get started with this.  Created repo for our tech website and began building that.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I have done so much just to get started, without actually creating anything (aside from useless example repos).  It felt silly to have a nice public webpage in which I built link to a lameass site for ourselves, so I started on our own site now. I created the header and navigation bar and also created a template css sheet for myself to stay organized.

**Link to work:** [Saunders Tech Site](https://github.com/segwyne/Saunders-tech-site)  I'm not sure how to link to a specific commit yet, or even if that is possible.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link(s) to work**: [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)


### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

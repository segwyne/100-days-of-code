# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 72 October 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: My husband got my jail setup in such a way that I can install plugins for my localhost WordPress.  Therefore I spent quite a bit of time today getting my localhost WordPress to match what I had deployed so far.  I got a little more styling done, too.  I fixed my broken mobile header (that was an easy fix once I actually looked at it), so that is a relief.

**Thoughts**: I need to explore my membership plugin because it came very highly rated in the WP repository, but I can't get it to so much as tell me when there is a new user that needs to be approved.  There was probably a tutorial that popped up when I first installed it that I ignored and should probably see if I can find now.

### Day 71 October 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I think I finished tweaking the Events styling, and I moved on to the Membership styling and settings.  The membership plugin is so much easier to modify because it is a normal (human-readable) css file instead of a single squished up line called a min css file.  With the Memberhsip settings, I may need to get some assistance from the designers because when I try to save email settings (such as for sending a welcome email when someone makes a new account) it gives me a gobbledygook page and doesn't actually save any of my settings.  I also need to figure out how to redirect some of the pages.  It would be nice to have an acknowledgment when a new registration is processed instead of just sitting there with the filled out form still on the screen without the password filled in.  Redirecting to a page that says thank you for registering would be nice.

**Thoughts**: I really much prefer the non min css files.  Really really prefer them.  I like that I am able to make a unified visual scheme for all the parts of the site so far.

### Day 70 October 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: More tweaking and aligning and coloring.  I added a search bar to the main menu and it does work (that took some effort that I wasn't expecting).  Sometimes when I fix one thing, it throws another out of whack.  I centered the images on the search results page so they didn't look awkward off to one side, and then my header was all misaligned.  I had to narrow down my focus to target just the right images.  I also created a front page with some relevant content and struck out the footer menu items that don't go anywhere.

**Thoughts**: I realized that if this is going to do the job I originally intended on the scale that I originally intended, there will likely be tens of thousands of events for it to process and parse.  I'm suddenly daunted by the scope of it. I guess that is a clue that my goal is the right size here. According to Brooke Castillo, if your goal doesn't scare you, it isn't big enough.

### Day 69 October 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I did some more styling of the calendar and single event pages.  Specifically, I aligned things closer to how I want them.  Still a bit to do, but I'm almost ready to call it done.

**Thoughts**: I don't think I got a full hour in today, but that is okay.  I got in some time at least.  Found another thing to add to my to-do list: Figure out why the Account menu drops down behind the calendar instead of in front of it.  Adding a z-index of 4 million something didn't help.

### Day 68 October 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I got WordPress to load my logo (I had to put it in the correct directory).  I also got to work recoloring my Event plugin so that it has the same color theme as the rest of the site instead of greyscale. I did not try to find the extra real estate on the screen.  I entered two events as sample data so I could test things out.  I also crossed out all the menu options that aren't developed yet.  But I can click on Calendar and it takes me there, and I can click on the site name and it takes me home.

**Thoughts**: It feels like I got a lot done today.  I like how it is turning out so far.  More things to add to my to-do list include playing with the alignments of the event pages (I focused only on the calendar page today, specifically in Month view), figuring out how I messed up my mobile header, and try out the membership plugin I downloaded and haven't looked at yet.

### Day 67 October 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I struggled with the WP rendition of the site for a good hour trying to figure out why it won't load my logo image.  I then switched over to the non-WP version and worked on getting the elements to line up in my header the way I want them to. I discovered that I now have excess real estate on the right side of my screen.  I need to identify it and get rid of it.  No one wants a horizontal scroll bar on a wide-screen desktop. 1920 pixels isn't enough?

**Thoughts**: I still have tweaks I want to make, but I also have laundry I have to fold, so more will have to wait until tomorrow.

### Day 66 October 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I worked on getting the site translated to WP, which is proving more finicky than other things I have done.  

**Thoughts**: It doesn't feel like I got anything accomplished today.  My logo won't show up in my header.  I'm still working out which elements of WordPress code I need in my theme since I'm not making a public theme this time, just a private one for this particular site.  Maybe I can copy everything over wholesale and not try to translate it.  But now I have to get ready for work.

### Day 65 October 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I got the logo to sit where I wanted it to, and also set it as the wallpaper.  I adjusted the font size in the header to be responsive, and also adjusted the menu to be better responsive.  It isn't live on the site yet, though.

**Thoughts**: I'm not sure if I like exactly how the background is working.  I will leave it and "try it on" for a while.

### Day 64 October 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I fixed some of the styling issues that happened when I switched to WordPress (building on the underscores theme like I did for the theme I submitted).  I also installed an event plug-in and created some categories.  

**Thoughts**: It is starting to feel a bit more real now, rather than just a concept in my head.

### Day 63-B October 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: It occured to me that I can just build my site on WordPress instead of trying to rebuild the database wheel.  In my day job, I am responsible for publicizing our activities on online calendars, and some of them use WordPress for the framework, so I can, too.  Today I spent my time transitioning it all over to WordPress.  I got it to look right so far over there, with the exception that now my links are all default colors instead of a consistent white.  My footer is a little out of whack, sitting a little higher than it is supposed to, also.  Projects for tomorrow.  I also made a logo.  

**Thoughts**: If using WordPress works as I hope it will, it will greatly speed up the launching of the site, which I keep renaming.

### Day 63 October 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I wrestled with the dozen radio buttons I had used, then I remembered that I could just use a dropdown box and simplify my code dramatically, so I did that.  I also started the page to process the addition of events to the database.

**Thoughts**: Not much.  I kept getting distracted by my music.  Next time, no lyrics.

### Day 62 October 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I didn't do any coding the last three days because I worked an extra 15 hours more than usual at my day job.  I just came home and crashed each night.  So today I created a page to take input for adding an event to the calendar.  I don't have the processing page yet, just the input page.  It is very basic and needs some serious styling.  But that can come after the processing.

**Thoughts**: I didn't feel like coding today, which is unusual.  I attribute it to my extra hours at work and wanting to get housework done instead.  I just set a timer and sat down to do it.  I did get into feeling like it, so that was good.

**Link to commit**: [Github link](https://github.com/segwyne/linenandiron/commit/1e73cf1fa6b36038188e068e25f99a5ec070e898)

### Day 61 October 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I sat down again and finished up the header.  Now all of the layout (as much as I have so far) looks just how I want it.

**Thoughts**: Pretty soon here, I will need to start adding content, which will mean learning new languages.  I also need to come up with a good name before too long.

**Link to work**: [Github link](https://github.com/segwyne/distaffandplough)

### Day 61 October 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I got the footer working right.  The menu is now centered along the bottom of the screen on a desktop and lined up vertically on my phone.  Next up: managing the header.

**Thoughts**: Centering the footer menu was a lot more complicated than I thought.  I expected only a line or three of code, but it took quite a bit.  I used solution #4 from (http://www.websitecodetutorials.com/code/css/css-center-nav.php).

### Day 60 October 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I got the footer made and just need to figure out why the menu won't center for me.  I also worked on styling the header, trying out a few different ideas.  Still not happy with it yet.

### Day 59 October 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I began creating the top navigation bar.  I am working on getting two separate menus to play nicely together in the same header.  I want one on the left and one on the right, and just like my kids, they keep getting into each other's space and making a mess.  I'm sure that I will see the obvious answer in the morning after a good night's sleep (the 5 hours I got last night doesn't cut it).

**Thoughts**: Still excited, but trying to pace myself.  No sense in pushing myself too hard and writing bad code that I will have to rewrite later just because I was tired and not thinking straight.

### Day 58 October 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I had a brilliant idea for a new website (well, I suppose we all think our ideas are brilliant :) ).  I'm going to make a website for historical re-enactors of all eras that will be a mashup of Facebook (friends, newsfeed), Ravelry (I've heard it called Github for knitters - project sharing), Meetup (organizing IRL meetings and events) and Etsy (shops), with a searchable calendar of living history events, a book review section, and a tutorial section.  I brainstormed a lot, I searched Hover.com for my favorite domain ideas, but I didn't actually get any code written.  I did get quite a lot written on paper.  I'm not sure if that counts.

**Thoughts**: I have no idea how I'm going to accomplish all of this.  I know it can be done since others have done all the components already, so I will be learning as I go.  Isn't that how it always goes?  I'm starting with the bits I do know - HTML and CSS to start.  Then I will learn whatever languages I need to create the backend.  So excited!

### Day 57 October 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I don't think I made any today.  I spent the whole time chasing that wretched photo out of my editor style and I still haven't succeeded.  I don't know how to get the background image out of the editor style when the editor-style.css doesn't have it in there at all.  I tried setting its background-image to none, and that didn't work either.  

**Thoughts**: Very frustrated with it.  I've decided to leave out editor styling for now and just include it in an update later.

### Day 56 October 6, 2018

**Recent Progress**: I have been trying to get my theme all ready for WordPress while I wait for it to get to the top of the queue.  I read lots of denials of themes, which taught me quite a bit about what they look for.  I have been spending the last few days working on those details.  My last hurdle (that I am currently aware of) may not be a deal-breaker for my theme, but it is annoying the bejabbers out of me, and I'm sure any future users of the theme will be equally annoyed.  I added editor styling but I can't figure out how to get it to stop loading up the background image, which it does very slowly, adding another few lines of pixels with every keystroke as I type, even if it is delete or backspace.  It also makes the text grey, which it certainly shouldn't be.

**Thoughts**: I am so glad I read through the denials and that the reviewers put in truly helpful information when they rejected.  

### Day 52 September 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I spent a stupid amount of time trying to manipulate a file and getting no results on my screen because I somehow managed to have to folders that were almost identical and I was manipulating the wrong one.  It was maddening.  Once I finally got into the correct file, I was able to easily make the changes that had been eluding me, namely, to make the site-branding in my theme consistent across pages and screen sizes.  Some pages were using a h1 tag, and others were using a p tag, so now they all use h1 tags and all show up the same way on each page.  Whew!  I also started a changelog for the theme.

**Thoughts**: I am finding so many things I want to tweak now that I have submitted it to WordPress.  :)  That's the way it goes, I suppose.

### Day 51 September 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent a huge amount of time  hunting in vain for my styling errors.  I want the semi-transparent content background to reach the bottom and I can't figure out how to do it.  I did fix my screenshot for WordPress and I got that uploaded.  I also started working on a page for my theme, but mostly I spend dissecting my theme to figure out the background issue.

**Thoughts**: I might be using the completely wrong tools for this job.  I thought I had made it work for my museum website, but when I dissected that further, I saw that it had the exact same issue, but the various elements are generally larger, so it isn't visible as an issue.

### Day 50 September 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I uploaded my theme Rustic to WordPress for inculsion in their repository.  I had to change the name of it to Sylvan because there was already a Rustic theme by another author.  That was disappointing.  It took a lot of tweaking to get my screenshot to look even close to correct.  I struggled with the appearance being different depending on if I was logged in or not.  I had removed a widget from the sidebar, and when I was logged in, it looked like it was gone.  As soon as I logged out to get a nice clean screenshot, it was back.  But I got the screenshot put together, and after a couple of unsuccessful attempts, I managed to get it uploaded and it passed the automated scan.  Yay!

**Thoughts**:  That was exhausting work.  I got very frustrated with the difference between logged in and logged out, so I took the screenshot while logged in and just cropped out the wp-admin toolbar.

### Day 49 September 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I got rid of my original Rustic project and renamed my remake as the original.  Not much, I know, but I am trying to get it ready for publication.  It would be silly to release a theme called Rustic2 without there being a Rustic first.

**Thoughts**: I'm nervous about it not being perfect when I release it.

### Day 48 September 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I made some tweaks to the margins and image styling of Rustic.  I also finally (after several tries) managed to update my local version of WordPress without FTP (we have a firewall in place that seems to block it).  I learned a teeny tiny bit about SVN.

**Thoughts**: So much to learn about the command line.  I'm tired of having to ask for help with things at that level.  I just want things to work.  They don't have to be super intuitive, but they should at least make sense, none of this chown and svnlite and chmod and chgrp and chpoopy.  Yes, I made up that last one, but I wouldn't be too terribly surprised if it were real at this point.

### Day 47 September 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I took a couple of days off for my mental sanity.  I cannot sit down and just code for one hour.  It always turns into 3-6 hours, and that was taking a heavy toll on my family and my health.  Today I downloaded the _s theme from WordPress and used it as the base for my new version of my Rustic theme.  Why is this all italicized now?  Hmmm.  I don't know how to unitalicize in this file.  I did a pretty decent job converting it over, if I do say so myself.  Using the theme as a template (not as a parent), I was able to add all the functionality I wanted my theme to have, like actually linking to the posts it was showing.

**Thoughts**: Ok, unitalicized again here.  I need to fix the bug in my navigation menu that leaves the menu there after it is deleted, but empties it once it is recreated before it is populated.  I will have to see about making this theme available on my site.  In the meantime, I "tested" it by applying it to my completely unrelated blog.  I like it.

### Day 46 September 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I experimented with copy-and-pasting segments of code from an existing WP theme (twentyfifteen) into my own code to make it work.  I managed to make the post titles be links on the home page, and (although I don't understand how) make the formatting of the post show up.

**Thoughts**: I still have much to learn about all of these WP functions that seem to run the show.  When I just tried pulling in the posts, they showed up as plain text paragraphs, with no tags, so the bullet lists and tables were just run on sentences.  I've also decided to pull back a little on the challenge.  Yesterday I had no time to breathe due to all the places I had to take my kids.  A week ago I took a sick day from the challenge because my health has been suffering from staying up until midnight or later doing this challenge instead of going to bed at a decent hour to getup at 5:30.  So my health has to come first.  I will do an hour on the days that I can find an hour, which I know kind of defeats the purpose of the challenge, but I will strive to keep my missed days to a minimum.

### Day 45 September 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today was not so productive.  I don't know if I got my full hour in or not, I suspect not.  I had a very full schedule today and just squeezed in a couple of minutes here and there.  What I *did* get done was offer to create a calendar database for my workplace, and get the database at least created and named with one table in it.  Our current website is all static pages (on purpose - no WordPress allowed), so every time something changes, I (or my boss) have to go in manually and change the code.  This occurs most often on our front page, which has a box of upcoming activities, and links to those activities as well as a link to the general calendar.  So it is a calendar snippet.  I plan to use the database to dynamically keep the upcoming events box on the front page up to date automatically.  That seems pretty simple.  Oh, and I also signed up for Code Triage, so I will see if I can get my feet wet there, too.

**Thoughts**: Hm.  I think I covered it in the progress report.

### Day 44 September 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today was a very productive day, I think.  In these last six hours, I majorly overhauled my business website.  I wrote an About page, I worked on my contact form, I wrote a much nicer front page.  

**Thoughts**: I practiced making text cut out photos, but after spending a good amount of time, I decided it wasn't what I wanted after all, so I returned to a simple text banner.  I learned new things in GIMP by doing this, though.  I also struggled with my contact form.  I can't get it to give an error and refuse to process if the email address isn't validated.  So instead, I wrote an autorespond script so that when the message goes through successfully (since it always says it does, even if the email is "an invalid email"), the system will send the message to me and a receipt notification to the email the sender used.

### Day 43 September 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I rewrote the style for my WordPress theme Rustic because I couldn't figure out why the original wasn't working.  I got all the structure to work, I got the styling to work.  I do not have the links working yet.

**Thoughts**: I hadn't noticed that the tutorial I was following had me pulling blog post info without linking to it, so I could see the title, date, and author of each post, but then I couldn't link to it, so it just sat there looking pretty.  Same with the Archive section.  They just return a page that says "Not Found".  I am really happy with the look of my design and cannot wait to get the links to function.

### Day 42 September 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my drop down menu templates.  I decided to see if I could duplicate the drop-down menu I had found online with my own CSS.  I tried making it with flexbox, but I discovered that that is impractical because with dropdown menus, the whole menu adjusts.  So no flexbox with drop-down menus.  

**Thoughts**: This is much trickier than I anticipated.  Maybe it is because I am still sick and I'm not making connections that I normally would. I really like flexbox and was disappointed that it didn't work.

### Day 42 September 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I took a sick day.

### Day 41 September 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I switched out the index page on my tech site so the original site shows up again.  I know that defeats the purpose of installing WordPress, but for now that is okay.  I also started the BootStrap lessons at W3Schools.com.  I learned about images, grid basics, alerts, wells, tables, typography, and jumbotron.

**Thoughts**: I wish there were more practical exercises.  Some of the lessons have no applied exercises at all, and others have ones that make me wonder why I would ever use it.

### Day 40 September 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I backed up my museum's website.  Manually, since I couldn't find my FTP credentials.  I also uninstalled and reinstalled my local WordPress, and now I have to wait until tomorrow when my husband can give aliases to my folders because they are "below root", and I don't understand that part.  I will stick to web design (for now) and let him handle the server management. I also familiarized myself with GitTea for those projects I don't want to make public on GitHub.

**Thoughts**: I'm mildly frustrated with all the trouble I have been having with WordPress.  And yes, I know the problem is all BKAC (Between Keyboard And Chair).  I will conquer this!

### Day 39 September 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I tried to wrap my brain around coding pages in WordPress, so I took the plunge and switched the site over.  I have used WordPress as a blog before, but not for static-ish pages.  For the contact page, I first just copied over the code I had written already and pasted it into the text editor of WordPress.  The contact form showed up when I previewed the page, so I copied over my processing/acknowledgement page the same way.  I could not figure out how to connect the two pages, though, and kept getting a 404 error when I tried to test my form.  I could preview my processing form and it showed both the success and failure messages.  When I tried to put that url into my form tag in the contact page, it woulnd't connect.  I finally gave up (for now) and downloaded a plug-in.  I also tried to change the colors on the theme from hot pink to navy blue, so I used the Editor in the Appearance menu of WordPress and switched out all the color codes, but when I refreshed the page, it was all still hot pink.

**Thoughts**: Coding is like cooking.  You can buy a frozen dinner and heat it up, you can buy a mix, add some butter and milk and an egg, toss it in the oven and call it done, or you can buy your ingredients and measure them all yourself.  I much prefer the last way.  It is an art.  The contact form felt very much like a boxed mix to me and I felt cheated of the experience of doing it myself.  I was heartbroken to see that all the coding I did is no longer available for anyone to see.  Sure, you can manually type in the URL, but you have to know it.  When you type in the domain name now, you just get a brand new blog with my name on it.

### Day 38 September 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I got my quotes to look the way I wanted.  Instead of blockquote:before or after, I classed the paragraphs inside the quote and used .quote:before and .attribution:after.  That gave me the functionality of inline display while still preserving the block display of the blockquote. I also created a contact page.  I included a secure mailto link created with javascript, as well as a form.  I also made myself an email to go with my tech domain.

**Thoughts**:  I'll be honest, the closer I get to being done with the site and actually looking for clients, the more anxious I get.  Building sites is in my comfort zone.  Looking for clients is not.  I still need to create error messages for the contact page.

### Day 37 September 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I worked on styling blockquotes today.  I started a class called Creating Clients, and Lesson 2 is to build yourself a webpage.  Since I already have one well underway, I looked at what their recommendations for a site include and created a Testimonials page.  I want each testimonial to be a blockquote, so I got to work on styling them.  Each one will have giant quotes at top left and bottom right corners.  Each has an attribution that has a tilde before it. 

**Thoughts**:  This is a great way to play around with :before and :after pseudo-elements.  I still have work to do.  I can get the opening quote in position, but not the closing one yet, and even with 0 margin and padding, there is a lot of space above it.  I'm sure that is from the line the quote sits on, since I moved it down to the line below, but the space is still held for it.  Oh! I wonder if I can set the blockquote to display inline instead of block.  But that kind of defeats the point of "block"quote.  More thinking on it later.

### Day 36 September 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I got quite a bit done (didn't confine myself to one hour, either). I added modals to show on mobile screens when opening the animations page or the slideshow page, warning that they are better viewed on larger screens.  I also added an animation to one of the slideshows that slides the photos in from the top.  Now all of the slideshows on that page have different features.  I also made all of my changes live.

**Thoughts**:  I like having all of the slideshows unique.  Before, I felt like one was redundant, showing the exact same features as the first.  It just felt like a placeholder for the layout.  Now I feel like it really has something to demonstrate.  I'm having trouble with some of my JS.  Sometimes I can't seem to call it from the external page, so I have to put it on the php page instead.  I probably need to go read some more on it.  I also wonder (and will try experimenting) if I can have one button trigger two different functions.  Like advance the photo and change the animation class.  Specifically I want to have photos going up in sequence slide in from the left, and photos going down in sequence slide in from the right.  I thought it would be great to have the photo slide the direction of the advancement arrow.

### Day 35 September 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: With some advice from this group on FB, I was able to fix that mysterious margin issue.  I had to set the height of my image container.

**Thoughts**: I still don't know where the extra 4 pixels under each image came from.  I didn't get a whole lot done today, but I think I'm getting sick, so I'm going to take care of my body and go to bed.

### Day 34 September 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I got a huge chunk of the CSS Rewrite done.  Now I'm fine-tuning my slide shows and photo galleries, trying to figure out why one will work and another nearly identical won't.

**Thoughts**:  I think my CSS is a bit cleaner now.  I still have a mysterious margin below my images.  It seems to be caused by styling my caption division, but I don't understand how.  Must get some sleep.

### Day 33 September 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I bit the bullet and restarted the whole CSS from almost nothing.  I kept the animations and then started rebuilding everything else.

**Thoughts**: There is much better retention when I type things out myself instead of using copy-and-paste.  It took me a while to get the correct order for @media only screen and (min-width: xyz).  I was recognizing it as a whole, but not as the individual parts until I typed it out several more times.

### Day 32 September 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on dissecting my tech site css.  I tried out other similar css sheets with the same html to try to identify when the problem was with the css or the html.  I keep getting weird spacers now, usually under elements or at the end of the page.  Like when body {height:100%} extends below the screen when there is only a sentence or two on the page. 

**Thoughts**: I'm thinking of ditching it and rewriting the whole thing from scratch.

### Day 31 September 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I decided to create a basic css sheet that I can just customize for each website I design.  I snipped out some features and made them their own reference files.  I also updated my sewing site, taking down the pricing for alterations since I decided that I am not going to offer that service anymore.  I didn't dissect the Tech site css yet.

**Thoughts**: A full month already!  And of course, I went and spent several hours again today.  It is addicting.  But most of that time was while the kids were at school and I didn't actually have other obligations.

### Day 30 September 3, 2018
**Today's Progress**: I added a footer to the website today, but it decided to be contrary and began at the top of my slideshow, so all of my photo galleries were in my footer (or at least had the background color for the footer).  I was able to fix that by adding div tags after my navigation bar and before my footer to enclose all the content in a div.content.  That put my footer where it belongs.  Then it decided to have funky padding.  1px of padding had the same visual effect as either 20px or 50px of padding. 0 padding had a definite effect, though.  Plainly I need to dissect my css.

**Thoughts**: I have been spending probably 4-6 hours a day on average coding here, and my that is way out of balance.  I need to rein it back to one hour each day.  So here is my one hour.

### Day 29 September 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: So that misalignment of the previous button in my slideshow was due to text-align: center instead of text-align: left.  It was a simple fix.  I created a photo gallery based off of the one at W3Schools, and it is driving me bonkers.  I can get it to work perfectly except that I have a white band between my photos and my caption.  I discovered that it is caused by declaring a DOCTYPE.  If I don't declare it, the page renders just fine.  If I do declare it, it adds this bar under all of the galleries.  I hadn't noticed before because I had nothing that was supposed to be touching the bottom of the photo before.  When I ran the debugger in Firefox (this problem appeared on Firefox, Chrome, Opera, and Edge - all the browsers I have access to right now), it looked like it was telling me that the html element was only reaching partway down my page. It is creating a 4 pixel gap.  I have a single pixel green border around all of my galleries now (for debugging purposes - it helps me know which element needs tweaking), and that is how I discovered it is affecting all of my galleries.

**Thoughts**: This issue is really bugging me.  Everything I read says that it is very important to declare a doctype, but I don't want my site to be broken.  How the heck did W3Schools get theirs to work?

### Day 28 September 1 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I was finally aple to import the tables from my spreadsheet backup into my reconstructed database.  Whew!  That sure saved a lot of typing or copy-and-pasting.  I also discovered what was causing my computer to get so incredibly bogged down - I wasn't closing my database connection properly on some pages. So it was opening a new connection every time I reloaded the page, and it never shut them down.  Seems to be all fixed now.  I went back to the tech site to try sprucing that up a bit.  I can't very well advertise as a web designer if my own webpage stinks.  I got my animations put up, and most of my slideshow.  The slideshow is being quirky, though.  It works perfectly well with one css sheet, but even though I copy-and-pasted the css specific to the slideshow from the old css sheet to the new one, the previous button has decided to sit in the middle of the photos instead of on the left side.  I remember I ran in this problem before, and even though I documented the bejabbers out of my css, I can't figure out how I fixed it last time.  I also created an external javascript page to keep those better organized.

**Thoughts**: I can see my improvement over this last month.  I can now read more code and understand it.  My boss told me today that I saved the museum anywhere from $5000 to $15,000 by redesigning their website.  That is apparently what she was quoted and it just wasn't in the budget.  My jaw dropped when she told me that.  I wonder if that is truly typical, because if that is the going rate for websites, then I need to learn how to drum up business.

### Day 27 August 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I mashed together a very inelegant solution to my "Array Array Array" problem, that involves running a while loop with only one record.  But it outputs actual data, which is what I needed.  I also had trouble with a corrupted table and then I couldn't repair it, or rebuild it, or replace it, so I ended up deleting the whole database and rewriting it.  So all of the structure is there now with no data in it. I did export the tables to a spreadsheet first, but then it didn't record the field names, so I had to figure out what each of the boolean fields were again.  And now I can't figure out how to import the data from the spreadsheet.  That is kind of depressing.

**Thoughts**: I'm sure there is a much more elegant way to create my search and output pages.  I have a page for each table I might want to search.  And that silly while loop has got to have a better answer.

### Day 26 August 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I created a page to look up Player characters.  The page queries the database and returns all the results.  I have the page now display the query results in alphabetical order by last name, then first name.  The results are clickable so that each result can take you to a page created for that player.  Working on getting the results to display actual data rather than "Array Array Array".

**Thoughts**: Every time now that I want to design something, I find myself wishing I could just do it with CSS.  That happened today at work when I was trying to create admission tickets.  "Why can't I just make a division here and style it?" Because LibreOffice Writer doesn't use divs.

### Day 25 August 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I now have the relationships established between my various tables (Players, Characters, Skills, Spells, Racial Traits, Plot stories). I finished creating the pages for the game's site, even if many pages have "Check back later" messages.  I put previous and next navigation buttons on the lore pages.  I fumbled around with the database some more.

**Thoughts**: I am haivng trouble figuring out how to build a form in LibreOffice Base that will pull data from lots of tables instead of just two.  I want it to show the character statistics, that character's skills (I've got that done), the players name (as referenced by a separate table, not yet done), any spells that character has learned (through another reference table) as well as the plotlines the character is involved in (from yet another table).  I suspect I can do it through an HTML form, but when I tried connecting HTML to MySQ last night, it really bogged down my machine, to the tune of waiting 3-5 minutes to see my mouse move, just like loading web pages in the early 90s over 28k modems.  I was cleaning the kitchen and checking in to see if it had moved yet.  So I need to figure out what I'm doing wrong there.

### Day 24 August 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I broke down the rulebook into individual sections for easier development and updating.  I slightly expanded the database and created some forms for data management.  I also started creating some web pages for database management.

**Thoughts**: This rulebook has way less info that I originally thought.  What it does have is pretty well fleshed out, and the rest of what is missing is easily recreated.  

**Link to work**: [Eltara repository](https://github.com/segwyne/Eltara)

### Day 23 August 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I got LibreOffice Base to connect to the MariaDB that my husband had installed on a jail for me.  I now have a form to show the characters that will cross reference various tables to show all of a character's information.  For example, I have a table of Character information (including name, ID#, player#, race, level, etc.), a table of different skills that are available (including skillID#, skill name, purchase cost, description), and a reference table that holds just the Character ID# and skill ID#s.  I use this to pull it all together and create a full picture of the character.

**Thoughts**: I have forgotten so much in 20 years.  I remember having lots of different features that I have to relearn how to create.  I will get there.

### Day 22 August 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued populating database.  Spell table is now 80% done.

**Thoughts**: Pretty much a continuation of yesterday.  Once I get all the skills and spells populated, I can begin with the coding necessary to create characters.

### Day 21 August 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I began populating the spell table of my game's database.  I got 40% done.

**Thoughts**: Data entry isn't quite as exciting as coding, but I need the tables populated so I can do all the fine-point coding later.

### Day 20 August 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: While rummaging around on our home file server, I discovered a roleplaying game I had written about 20 years ago and never playtested.  I fell in love with it all over again and created a database with LibreOffice Base to start making the game playable.  I created tables for players, characters, skills, spells, and items.  I populated the entire skills table.  I made my husband put the kids to bed so I could immerse myself in this project, promising that I would not be up all night long.  I also started the SQL lessons on W3Schools, and learned about syntax, select, select distinct, where, and, or, not, order by, insert into, null values, update, delete, select top, min, and max.

**Thoughts**:  I feel like I have found a long-lost child.

**Link to work**: None yet.  It is all on my hard drive.

### Day 19A August 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I learned about booleans, comparisons, conditions, switch, and loops.  I added code to my dice page to allow the user to roll multiple dice at the same time.  It also documents on the screen what it is doing.

**Thoughts**: I was really itching to make multiple dice possible.  That's why I did a couple more hours here tonight.

**Link to work**: [Dice page](https://saunderstechnology.com/dice.php)

### Day 19 August 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned about the random function in Javascript, so I got the great idea of creating a character generation page for table-top RPGs (such as Dungeons and Dragons).  So far, my page will roll one die of a user-entered size.  But I've got big plans for it!  If only I had a group to game with again, I might actually be able to put this to use.  I miss gaming.

**Thoughts**: I would like to expand this into a complete character generation and storage system, so that gamers can quickly create characters, store them online, update them, and print them out for gaming sessions.

### Day 18 August 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I did this a day early since I won't have any time tomorrow (August 22) to sit and code.  I made the navigation responsive, and I also made the animations page responsive.  I made the animations themselves smaller in scope to be easily viewed on a phone, but then the in between sizes of a tablet were throwing me for a loop, so I decided to just offer the animations on large screens, and put a message to show on smaller screens asking them to view the animations on a large screen.  I also switched all of the files on the live site to PHP, even though I am testing them using HTML on my local machine.

**Thoughts**: I understand the responsive navbar better now.  Even though I had deployed one before, that was pure copy-and-paste code that I didn't fully understand.  Now I understand how the checkbox method works, and how to hide the ugly checkbox.

### Day 17 August 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: In Javascript, I learned about strings, numbers, arrays, and dates.  I created a box to display the current date at the bottom of my front page.

**Thoughts**: The arrays were very confusing to me.  I couldn't see the "how" behind the methods, specifically the comparisons.  I can see that it does work, I just don't understand how it works.  I was also a little frustrated that at one point the lessons said, "You do x this way, but don't do it that way because it complicates the code and slows it down."  Then why did you say I can do it that way?  And then later, "This is how y works.  There is no reason to use it in your code."

### Day 16 August 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the JS lessons for 45 minutes and learned about assignments, data types, functions, objects and events. I then moved the silliness items from my sewing page to a demo page on the tech site, where it makes much more sense for them to be.  I also used the JS I just learned to make the buttons change the class of the animation box so I have one div that applies different animations instead of having different divs that either display or don't.  Now it is one div, and the button changes its class.  I also changed the buttons to call functions instead of having the JS written right into the HTML of the button.  I also took my face off of it and just used a colored block div.  The face was actually a little scary, according to my kids.

**Thoughts**: Spelling matters!  Typing "dispaly" instead of "display" will make the entire function fail.

**Link to work**: [Saunders Technology](https://saunderstechnology.com/animations.html)

### Day 15 August 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I started the Javascript section of W3Schools, then to put that into practice, I wrote some JS buttons to turn the animations from yesterday on and off.

**Thoughts**: I'm having just a little trouble with the box animation and making it mobile-friendly.  I want it to go right down to the top of the footer (with some margin), but it is using way too much margin unless I put in absolute distances.  I tried using "top: calc(100% - 100px)" but that wasn't giving me the results I wanted.  It is like there is another section between the division the animation is in and the footer, but there is nothing there that I can find.  I tried shutting off the padding, but that didn't help, so I am using "top: 350px" instead, which isn't so friendly for phones.

### Day 14 August 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I finished all of the CSS exercises on W3Schools.com.  There was more CSS after that, so I went ahead and got to work on that.  After a few hours, I realized I hadn't done any coding at all yet, so I created some silliness on my page.

**Thoughts**: Coding after 3 shots of Schnapps leads to some interesting ideas for demonstrations.

### Day 13 August 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I conquered the multi-slideshow challenge!  I got four slideshows on one page, two portrait oriented and two landscape oriented.  I made them so they won't pile on top of each other, I tweaked the JS to include the extra slideshows, I made them stack vertically on small screens and in a grid on large screens.

**Thoughts**: I am very proud of myself for getting this done.  I still want to make the slideshows shrink to fit on tiny screens without scrolling, so I will start there tomorrow.  Then I will figure out how to merge branches.

### Day 12 August 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: It doesn't look like I did anything at all today except copy my php file into html so I can run it locally. I experimented with flex-box for my slideshows, but I still have some debugging to do before I can really try it again.  Some issues I encountered in my experimentation today included having one slidedhow sit on top of the other, and having the "next" buttons decided to align to the right of the screen instead of the right of the division while the "prev" buttons behaved just fine.

**Thoughts**: I'm tempted to throw in the towel on this and choose a different way to display the shows, but the whole point of this is the process not the product, so I need to stick with creating my original vision until I make it real instead of giving up and creating a different look that is just "good enough for now".  No, I need to go with exactly what I envisioned.  I'm way more product-oriented than process-oriented, so this is good practice for me.

### Day 11 August 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I fixed the sticky-outy part of the caption on my slideshow by removing some padding.  I added a second slideshow, just because.  I did have to look up how to make the same JS work for both slideshows, and it took me a while to discover that I had one extra tweak to make to make each set of advance buttons work on their own slideshows.  All the buttons were working for one slideshow, and ignoring the other, so I got that fixed.  At the end of the hour, I was still working on getting the slideshows to sit nicely on the page.  I got them to sit side-by-side instead of above/below, but they are squished up against one side for now.  I guess that's where I'll start tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: Yes, I like to do things simply to see if I can.  I want to explore having portrait-oriented slideshows and landscape-oriented slideshows on the same page.  I currently have one of each, and they need a lot more styling work.

**Link to work**: On Github: [Commit 14 on Segwyne's Needle](https://github.com/segwyne/segwynes-needle/commit/cc82177cc911b15b3e1d41b3637f847e75c49360)
Live site: [Segwyne's Needle: Showcase](http://segwynesneedle.com/showcase.php)

### Day 10 August 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I want slideshows of my work on my Showcase page, so I began by creating one.  Or mostly creating one.  I am using placeholder photos of the autumn beauty where I live until I get nice photos of my clothing.  The caption bar sticks out a bit on the side, but after spending an hour and a half sifting through my Google Photos, and then another hour and a half coding (since sifting through photos doesn't really count as coding), I am exhausted.  So I will fix the sticky-outy bar tomorrow.  I blatantly copy-and-pasted the JavaScript portion, and tweaked it to remove the parts I didn't use, and change to the names I did use.  This will be unallowable once I start learning Javascript.

**Thoughts**: I probably over-documented the Media section of my stylesheet.  But this is a section I am still learning, so I want to know exactly which line does what at this point.  I am hoping to make multiple slideshows on this page and am wondering if flexbox would be helpful since some photos are landscape, and some are portrait orientation.  Now that I actually think about it, each slideshow should probably be put on its own page, linked to from a thumbnail photo to preserve bandwidth and load time.

### Day 9 August 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I created a Price List for my sewing business, thought the prices themselves need to be updated.  I just brought the content over from my original weebly site and then formatted and styled it.  I used :first-child and :last-child to set the widths on my table because I didn't want to apply a class to every single data cell. I also figured out why my footer wasn't showing up properly on my About page.  I was missing the initial < sign to open the php tag.  Fixed that, too.

**Thoughts**: I don't like tables, but they seem to be a necessary evil sometimes.

### Day 8 August 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I focused on the CSS class at W3Schools.com today.  I learned about rounded corners, border images, backgrounds, colors, gradients, and shadows.

**Thoughts**: Much of this I had already been exposed to through my Frankenstein method of website building for the Fort, but I want to go through the whole class in order, without skipping anything.  I don't want to be arrogant and think I already know what the lesson is going to teach me.

**Link to work**: Again, none.  I just worked through the tutorials.

### Day 7 August 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I didn't do much actual coding today.  I decided to finish up the CSS course at W3Schools that I had begun and learned something so I went to go make a fix to the website I built for my work and discovered that my boss had made some changes because that I thought were ill-advised.  I had specifically kept the dropdown menu a different color from the main menu so that there would be a visual distinction when viewed on a phone, but that meant that on the larger size screen the dropdown menu items were the same color as the body background.  I was going to adjust the borders so that it had side borders, but she changed the background color instead.  So I changed it back and added the side borders.  Since this is not the first time she has altered the site (and slightly broken it) since it went live a couple of weeks ago, I decided to back up all the files to my own server.  Just in case I need them later.  :)  Since I haven't figured out how to use FTP, I had to do this manually by downloading every file one at a time.  Altogether, it took up the whole hour.

**Thoughts**: I really want to get on to learning PHP , but it looks like I really should finish CSS and Javascript first.  I already finished the basic HTML course, and was well over halfway through the CSS, so I am going to plug away at those some more.

**Link to work**: None, really.  I suppose I can link to [my work website](http://fortat4.org), the one I just fixed again and backed up.  

### Day 6: August 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I actually put in two hours today, not one.  I probably did on some previous days, too.  I worked on the processing page for my contact form.  It is coming along.  It mostly functions.  It gets the data to me, but it isn't validating anything yet.  Looks like that will be tomorrow's project.  I also switched all of my placeholder pages from html to php so I can work with just one file for making changes to the header or footer.

**Thoughts**: I think I need to start setting a timer for myself so I know when my hour is up.  Taking the time to actually type the code instead of copy/pasting it really does make a huge difference in learning it.

**Link to work**: [Commit #11 for Segwyne's Needle](https://github.com/segwyne/segwynes-needle/commit/ca36b8c0bef3ac6c806cb58f85813e82262ecda5)


### Day 5: August 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I created a contact form page, but not the processing page to go with it.  I also created my About page.  When I tested my contact page in mobile view, I noticed that my fixed footer obscured the bottom of my content, including my Submit button, so I added padding to the bottom of the content division to counteract that.  I also tried unsuccessfully to make my navbar sticky when it hits the top of my page.  I see lots of JS methods to do it, but I'm not familiar enough with JS and I thought that position: sticky was supposed to work for that.  But it won't for me.

**Thoughts**: Honestly, I didn't expect to get an hour of coding in today once I completed my other obligations.  But once the kids were in bed, I sat down, deciding that a half hour was better than nothing, and I think I coded a full hour or more.  My hubs will be getting up in an hour and a half, so I need to hasten off to bed before that.  The running dishwasher will still give me away in the morning, but I won't go to bed with a kitchen full of dirty dishes.  I also decided to change the orientation of this log so that I do not have to scroll to the bottom to update it each time.

### Day 4: August 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I worked on finishing up my navigation menu and created a footer.  Both sections use flexbox.  I adjusted the navigation so that the mobile version has a pull-down menu instead of taking up half of the screen's real estate with the menu, and rearranged a couple of items.

**Thoughts**: I'm understanding the flexbox system better now.  I can write the code now without having to look it up so much.  As I work on this site, I start to wonder what content I will use to actually fill the pages.  I guess my favorite part is making the theme.

### Day 3: August 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I spent quite a while wrestling with background images before finally deciding to just use a solid background color instead.  I used both CSS and GIMP in the wrestling process.  I also looked up the answer to get rid of the ridiculous amount of white space I had all around my header, and did that.  I pored over fonts to decide which one I liked and would play nicely with me and integrated that, too.

**Thoughts**: The mobile-first approach is much easier for me to do when I open a second browser and just reduce the size way down to 360 px.  Otherwise I get to imagining the full screen version first instead.  I know it doesn't look like I did a lot with my coding, but that is because I kept having to undo what I tried.   I was failing my way to success.  "Nope, wrong road again!"

### Day 2: August 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started working on my sewing website so I can save working on the tech site to do with Btechie. I created the repo, uploaded the very base files I had already.  I worked on making the flexbox navigation work, and worked on the background for the header using GIMP.  

**Thoughts**: I get frustrated with the git commands, particularly when I hve existing files and can't reconcile them with the repo.  I resorted to moving the files I had just worked on to a holding space, then deleting and remaking the folder for them, pulling the git from Github, and then adding the updated folders back into the new folder and then I was able to push them.  Very frustrating.  But I finally got it accomplished and I can focus on just the actual coding part in the future.

### Day 1: August 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Went through multiple tutorials on how to use GitHub so I can get started with this.  Created repo for our tech website and began building that.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I have done so much just to get started, without actually creating anything (aside from useless example repos).  It felt silly to have a nice public webpage in which I built link to a lameass site for ourselves, so I started on our own site now. I created the header and navigation bar and also created a template css sheet for myself to stay organized.

**Link to work:** [Saunders Tech Site](https://github.com/segwyne/Saunders-tech-site)  I'm not sure how to link to a specific commit yet, or even if that is possible.
